          &ldquo;Eli hit the ground running and quickly began to pull together
          pieces of the project in an independent manner with little guidance.
          Eli has exceptional communications skills and was able to present even
          the bioinformatics aspects of the project to us in a clear manner. I
          would highly recommend Eli to anyone who wants to expand their
          company's research/capabilities with a project incorporating
          bioinformatics and NextGen Sequencing analysis.&rdquo;

          &ldquo;Our company has greatly benefited from our association with Eli
          Fine. He has a deep understanding of the science and has assisted with
          key portions of our patent filings and a successful SBIR grant
          application. By training our lead scientist in new techniques and
          providing experimental designs, Eli allowed us to rapidly acquire
          vital new data. I would highly recommend Eli's services to small
          businesses in the genomics field.&rdquo;

          &ldquo;Eli is very intelligent, thinks critically and independently,
          and has excellent communication skills. He is highly motivated, works
          very hard, and gets along very well with others. He has an unusual
          ability of combining physical and bioinformatics modeling with wet-lab
          biological experiments, and developing computational algorithms for
          better design of engineered nucleases.&rdquo;
